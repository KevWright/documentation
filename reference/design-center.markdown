The Design Center is a public repository for customizable CFEngine design 
patterns and code. [Sketches][Sketch Structure] are ready-to-use components 
(e.g. collections of bundles, support files, etc.) that can be directly 
imported and used in CFEngine policies. Most sketches are specialized for 
achieving specific tasks, or for maintaining a specific piece of software, 
however their scope and capabilities can be varied. They are organized in 
categories according to their functionality. Sketches are managed (installed, 
configured, enabled and uninstalled) through a specialized tool called 
`cf-sketch`.

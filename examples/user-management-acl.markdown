## Manage users

There are many approaches to managing users. You can edit system files like /etc/passwd directly, or you can use commands on some systems like ‘useradd’ or ‘adduser’. In all cases it is desirable to make this a data-driven process.

    Add users
    Remove users

### Add users

A simple approach which adds new users to the password file, and to a group called ‘users’ in the group file. Is shown below. This example does not edit the shadow file. A simple pattern that can be modified for use is shown below.

Note that, although this is a simple minded approach, it is the most efficient of the approaches shown here as all operations can be carried out in a single operation for each file.

A second approach is to use the shell commands supplied by some operating systems; this assumes that suitable defaults have been set up manually. Also the result is not repairable in a simple convergent manner. The command needs to edit multiple files for each user, and is quite inefficient.


[%CFEngine_include_example(add_users_1.cf)%]

An alternative approach is to use a method to wrap around the handling of a user. Although this looks nice, it is less efficient than the first method because it must edit the files multiple times.


[%CFEngine_include_example(add_users_1.cf)%]

### Remove users


[%CFEngine_include_example(remove_users.cf)%]

## Add users to passwd and group ##

Add lines to the password file, and users to group if they are not already there.

## Basic Example ##

To get started with CFEngine, you can imagine the following template for entering examples. This part of the code is common to all the examples.


[%CFEngine_include_example(basic_example.cf)%]

Then you enter the cases as below. The general pattern of the syntax is like this (colors in html version: red, CFEngine word; blue, user-defined word):


[%CFEngine_include_example(basic_example_1.cf)%]

## Hello world


[%CFEngine_include_example(hello_world.cf)%]

## Array example ##


[%CFEngine_include_example(array_example.cf)%]

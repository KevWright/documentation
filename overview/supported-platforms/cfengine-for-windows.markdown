CFEngine supports Microsoft Windows machines as client hosts, but with some functional differences compared with POSIX platforms, such as Unix and Linux.

At the same time, CFEngine also does not currently support Windows policy servers. This however does not need to become a limitation to those who wish to deploy CFEngine in a Windows only IT environment. It is quite easy to setup a virtual machine running a popular flavor of Linux with minimal effort and under certain conditions no or low cost. See the instructions for deploying [CFEngine from Windows to an Amazon Web Services virtual machine running Red Hat Enterprise Linux][Installing CFEngine on RHEL Using AWS] for an example.

The CFEngine application is fully contained within the /var/cfengine directory tree. Here is a quick breakdown of the directory structure and some of the files and functions associated with each subdirectory.

## Components in /var/cfengine/bin ##

### Agents ###

* `cf-agent`: Executes the promises.cf file; ensures that all promises are being kept
* `cf-consumer`
* `cf-hub`
* `cf-key`
* `cf-promises`: Verifies CFEngine's configuration syntax
* `cf-runagent`: Contacts a remote system to run cf-agent
* `cf-twin`

### Daemons ###

* `cf-execd`: Starts the cf-agent process at a specified time interval.
* `cf-monitord`: Collects system statistics
* `cf-serverd`: Provides network services; used to distribute policy and data files

## Sub-Directories in /var/cfengine ##

[/bin](#/var/cfengine/bin)
* `/cfapache`
* `/config`
* `/design-center`
* `/httpd`
* `/inputs`

Cached policy repository located on a CFEngine client. The cf-agent executable executes policies from this repository.

* `/lastseen`
* `/lib`

Directory to store shared objects and dependencies that are in the bundled packages. 

* `/lib-twin`
* `/masterfiles`

Policy repository which grants access to local or bootstrapped CFEngine clients when they need to update their policies. Policies obtained from /var/cfengine/masterfiles are then cached in /var/cfengine/inputs for local policy execution. The cf-agent executable does not execute policies directly from this repository.

* `/master_software_updates`
* `/modules`
* `/outputs`

Directory where cf-agent creates its output files.

* `/plugins`
* `/ppkeys`

Directory used to store encrypted public/private keys for CFEngine client/server network communications.

* `/reports`

Directory used to store reports generated by cf-report.

* `/share`
* `/software_updates`
* `/ssl`
* `/state`

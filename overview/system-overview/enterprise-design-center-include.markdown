## Design Center Beta ##

### Graphical User Interface for Design Center ###

Deploy infrastructure policy "Sketches" using a form-based approach to configure properties, selecting the hosts that need to be impacted, and then tracking the progress of the deployment via the Mission Portal user interface.  

### Delegation of System Administrator Tasks ###

CFEngine experts can create their own Sketches, that match the exact needs of the organization in which they are used. They can be hosted in the Design Center repository, so that other administrators, developers and line-of-business users can use them to perform sophisticated sysadmin tasks without the need for detailed CFEngine knowledge. 

### Version Control for Sketches ###

CFEngine Enterprise keeps track of all changes in sketches and sketch-deployments, using Git-integration to track autors, source-code and meta-information about policy deployments.
